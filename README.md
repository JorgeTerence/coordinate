# Coordinate - a quick and simple file sharing solution

<!-- Logo -->

## What is this?

Coordinate is a terminal based file sharing utility. Have you ever just wanted to share a PDF or picture to your peers, to your phone or another computer but had to use a USB stick or send it via a messaging app? (Apple users yeah ik you exist and your life is wonderful) With this tool, you can launch a web page - a coordinate - with the files from your working directory so that others can access it via the local network.

## Plans for the future

- **GUI client:** people other than devs want to share their files. And my guess is that most of them don't usually use their terminal to navigate their file system. So a GUI client or a system tray action would be better suited.

- **Customization:** allow ricers to spend 8+ hours creating their own templates and stylesheets.

- **QR code generator** for accessing the coordinate without typing a long network address.

## TODO
